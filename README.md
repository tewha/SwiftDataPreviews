# SwiftDataPreviews

Based on Apple Sample Code [Building a document-based app using SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building-a-document-based-app-using-swiftdata).

License, etc. are from Apple.

Goals:

1. Make the app function as it should.
2. Add previews to all views.

If you know how to solve a problm here, a pull request is appreciated. Otherwise I'll muddle!
